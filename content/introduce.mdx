### Authentication & Authorization
- **Better Auth v1.3.34** - Modern authentication library with built-in support for:
  - Email and password authentication
  - Admin plugin for user management
  - Access control plugin for role-based permissions
  - Secure session management with cookie-based authentication

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** - Robust relational database for data persistence
- **node-postgres (pg)** - Native PostgreSQL driver for Node.js

### UI/UX
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Tailwind Typography** - Beautiful typographic defaults for content-rich pages
- **shadcn/ui** - High-quality, accessible React components built on Radix UI:
  - Avatar, Button, Checkbox, Dropdown Menu, Input, Label, Separator, Skeleton
- **Lucide React** - Modern icon library with 1000+ carefully crafted icons
- **next-themes** - Perfect dark mode implementation with zero-flicker theme switching
- **Sonner** - Elegant toast notifications

### MDX Support
- **@mdx-js/react & @mdx-js/loader** - Write JSX in markdown documents
- **@next/mdx** - First-class MDX support in Next.js with full component integration

### Form Validation
- **Zod v4** - TypeScript-first schema validation for forms and API endpoints

### Development Tools
- **ESLint 9** - Code quality and consistency enforcement
- **next-config with turbopack** - Ultra-fast bundler for development

## Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication System
- Secure email and password registration
- Login with session management
- Cookie-based authentication with automatic token refresh
- User profile dropdown with avatar support
- Protected routes and API endpoints

### 🛡️ Authorization & Permissions
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained permissions for users and sessions
- Custom 401 Unauthorized and 403 Forbidden error pages
- Admin capabilities for user management

### 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)
- Multi-language support (English, Dutch)
- Middleware-based locale routing
- Dictionary system for translations
- Automatic locale detection and redirection

### 🎨 Theme Support
- Light and dark mode with smooth transitions
- Theme-aware color system using CSS variables
- Consistent typography across all pages
- Accessible color contrast ratios

### 📝 Content Management
- MDX support for rich content pages
- Markdown with embedded React components
- Typography-optimized layouts
- Theme-aware prose styling

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Experimental Partial Prerendering (PPR)
- Optimized fonts and images
- Standalone output for efficient deployments
- React Suspense with skeleton loading states

### 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline
- Jenkins integration for automated builds
- Multi-stage deployment pipeline
- SSH-based deployment to production servers
- PM2 process management for zero-downtime deployments
- Environment-specific configurations

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights
- **Server Components by default** - Optimal performance with server-first rendering
- **Type-safe routing** - Fully typed route parameters and search params
- **API routes** - RESTful endpoints for data mutations and external integrations
- **Server Actions** - Direct server-side mutations without API routes
- **Middleware** - Request interception for auth, locale, and routing logic
- **Standalone build** - Self-contained deployment with minimal dependencies

```

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**: Run `npm run dev` for hot-reload development server on port 3002
2. **Type Checking**: TypeScript validates code at build time and in IDE
3. **Linting**: ESLint ensures code quality and consistency
4. **Building**: `npm run build` creates optimized production bundle with standalone output
5. **Production**: `npm run start` serves the built application

## Security Features

- Environment variable management with `.env.local`
- CSRF protection built into Better Auth
- Secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Type-safe database operations with Zod validation

## Scalability Considerations

- **Standalone output** - Minimal footprint for containerization
- **Database pooling** - Efficient PostgreSQL connection management
- **Server Components** - Reduced client-side JavaScript
- **Incremental Static Regeneration** - Balance between static and dynamic content
- **API route optimization** - Efficient data fetching and caching strategies
